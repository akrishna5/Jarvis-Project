## Personal Speech Recognition Assistant
A voice assistant which can be used to interact with your computer and controls your pc operations.

## Made with Python on VSCode
I tried to make this similar to JARVIS (in IRON MAN movie)

## NOTE:
It's not as intelligent as in the movie, but it can do a lot of cool things and automate your daily tasks we do on our personal laptops.

## Requirements:
 - pyaudio
 - pyttsx3
 - speechRecognition
 - wikipedia

## How to use Jarvis:
(Voice Mode)
 - Run the program on the terminal ``` python assistant.py ```
 - Interact by speaking through laptop microphones

Have Fun! Enjoy👨‍💻🙂
